            In addition to basic features such as a discussion forum and interactive chatbot, we offer many useful advanced features for the learning process. Notably, we have developed two fully functional features: Summarize and Explain, which help to summarize complex issues into main ideas and explain them in an easy-to-understand manner through artificial intelligence. Simply provide the system with a text passage or an image of text from a book, PDF, or scanned document, and it will automatically read and perform the task excellently as you requested.

            With these features, we hope to help save study time and enable you to excel in your work.
